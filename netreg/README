This file is for things with which to destroy netreg! 

preregged is a list of IP addresses that have been pre-registered on
NetReg and can be automatically allocated.

in-use is a subset of preregged, a list of IP addresses that are in
use, and a hack that will be unnecessary very soon (as the goal is to
just use reverse DNS to detect usage)

get_ip.sh gets an IP! run it for usage info!
